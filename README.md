``Project description``

`The purpose of the project is to provide users with the ability to search and find the list of books authored by their favourite author. Using the web application, users will be able to access the title, year of publication of the relevant books. I used the Open Library api (https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q) to search for books based on the name of the author.`

`In its current state, the website is functional and displays books for most authors. However, for some authors, the books are not displayed onto the DOM eventhough the fetching is successful (status: 200) and that the response is ok. I will keep on working on this problem and try to fix it soon.`

``Reflection (Optional)``
```What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?```
    I believe that I have approached the assignment methodically. First, I decided on the project that I wanted to work on. Then, I found a couple of APIs and tested them to identify the one that works best and caters to my need. After this, I started on working on the projectin a step-by-step manner. Overall, I feel good about my methodology. 

```Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?```
    No, the requirements are straightforward. 
```What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?```
    I will keep on adding more features and functionalities to the website. Also, I will keep on finding the reason why the books of some authors are not displayed and I will fix it.
```Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again.```
    I am developing my skills in applying what we learned in class quickly to the projects. In this and past SBA, I had to search and learn about a lot of things, which is both fun and educational. I will keep on doing that.
